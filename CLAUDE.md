## Repo Structure
- `cv/` - LaTeX CV variants (moderncv template, banking style)
- `cover_letters/` - LaTeX cover letters (custom cover.cls template)
- `.claude/skills/` - AI skill definitions for the application workflow
- `.agents/skills/` - Job search CLI tools

## Workflow for New Job Applications
1. User provides a job posting (URL or text)
2. **Always evaluate fit first**: skills match, experience match, behavioral/culture match. Present this assessment to the user before proceeding.
3. If good fit: create targeted CV (`cv/main_<company>.tex`) and cover letter (`cover_letters/cover_<company>_<role>.tex`)
4. **Verify both documents** against the full checklist in `.claude/skills/job-application-assistant/08-verification-checklist.md`
5. Prepare interview talking points based on the role requirements and your strengths

**Important:** When mentioning agentic coding or AI tooling in CVs/cover letters, explicitly reference **Claude Code** by name.

## Verification Checklist

> Full pass/fail checklist: `.claude/skills/job-application-assistant/08-verification-checklist.md` (loaded by the job-application-assistant skill during CV/cover-letter work).

After creating or updating a CV or cover letter, verify it before presenting to the user: factual accuracy, targeting, consistency, quality, the **MANDATORY** compiled-PDF inspection (never skip - compile the CV with lualatex and the cover letter with xelatex, then visually read the PDF output), and ATS/keyword coverage. Run the complete checklist from the reference file above and report the results as a pass/fail list.
